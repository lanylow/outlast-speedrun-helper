Free and open-source tool for Outlast (both 64 and 32 bit) and Outlast 2 that lets you save up to four different positions and teleport back to them. It has the same funcionality as the original speedrun helper made by Instagibz.

## FAQ

### Why?
I think that simple practice tools such as this one should be open-source. The original project is closed-source, so I decided to create my own version.

### How do I use it?
This tool works the same way as the original version, but here are the step-by-step instructions:
1. Download the archive from the [latest release](https://github.com/lanylow/outlast-speedrun-helper/releases).
2. Extract the executable into a directory of your choice.
3. Open the game.
4. Launch the executable you downloaded and follow the instructions.
